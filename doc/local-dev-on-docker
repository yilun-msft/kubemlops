Problem Statement:

Development in Docker locally can be a big pain. It is slow. A developer is waiting a painful amount of time for the container to restart.

Solution:

What if there was a way to bind mounts to share your project directory with a running container so that you can reuse your dev Docker image a lot. Continue reading to find out how!

Place Your Project Directory Into Docker

Typically, your developement should be designed for fast iterations. However, with Docker, many believe you must create a complete Docker image when deploying your code in the dev environment. That's not needed.
Instead, you can share your code with a started container by using bind mounts. This'll prevent you from creatinga a new image on each each.

When starting a new container using Docker CLI, here's how you mount a local "./source_dir":
  
  Docker CLI (two different options):
  $ docker run -it -v "$(pwd)/source_dir:/app/target_dir" ubuntu bash
  $ docker run -it --mount "type=bind,source=$(pwd)/source_dir,target=/app/target_dir" ubuntu bash
  ![mount bind](https://docs.docker.com/storage/images/types-of-mounts-bind.png)
